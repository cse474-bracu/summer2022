We will closely follow the benchmarks from the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.14165.pdf">GPT-3 paper</a>, which include:</p><ul><li>standard NLP benchmarks (e.g., question answering), as well as<li>quirky one-off demos (e.g., using a new word in a sentence).</ul><p>In comparison with the state-of-the-art-result for each task, the results are <strong>mixed</strong>:</p><ul><li>On some tasks such as language modeling, GPT-3 exceeds the state-of-the-art by a <strong>huge margin</strong>.<li>On others, where GPT-3 is competing against systems that are trained with large amounts of labeled data, it <strong>lags far behind</strong>.</ul><p>The way to think about these results is as follows:</p><ul><li>GPT-3 was <strong>not trained on these tasks</strong> explicitly; it was just trained as a language model to predict the next word.<li>Nonetheless, <strong>even without “trying”</strong>, GPT-3 does a passable job on average at a broad range of NLP tasks.<li>Because GPT-3 was not trained on any of these tasks, it hasn’t overfit, which means it has a <strong>good chance of doing well at many many other tasks</strong> (as seen by the passable performance on one-off tasks).<li>Moreover, if you wanted to do well on any particular task (e.g., question answering), you should in principle be able to <strong>adapt GPT-3 using the large amounts of labeled data</strong> to exceed state-of-the-art.</ul><p><strong>Adaptation</strong>. Recall that a <strong>language model</strong> \(p\) is a distribution over sequences of tokens \(x_{1:L}\) and thus can be used to score sequences:</p>\[p(\nl{the}, \nl{mouse}, \nl{ate}, \nl{the}, \nl{cheese}).\]<p>It can also be used to perform conditional generation of a completion given a prompt:</p>\[\nl{the mouse ate} \generate{} \nl{the cheese}.\]<p>A <strong>task</strong> is a mapping from inputs to outputs. For example, for question answering, we might have:</p><blockquote><p>Input: What school did burne hogarth establish?<br /> Output: School of Visual Arts</p></blockquote><p>We use the term <strong>adaptation</strong> to refer to the process of taking a language model and turning it into a task model, given:</p><ul><li>a natural language <strong>description</strong> of the task, and<li>a set of <strong>training instances</strong> (input-output pairs).</ul><p>There are two primary ways to perform adaptation:</p><ol><li><strong>Training</strong> (standard supervised learning): train a new model that maps inputs to outputs, either by<ol><li>creating a new model that uses the language model as features (probing), or<li>starting with the language model and updating it based on the training instances (fine-tuning), or<li>something in between (lightweight fine-tuning).</ol><li><strong>Prompting</strong> (in-context learning): Construct a prompt (a string based on the description and training instances) or a set of prompts, feed those into a language model to obtain completions.<ol><li>Zero-shot learning: number of training examples is 0<li>One-shot learning: number of training examples is 1<li>Few-shot learning: number of training examples is few</ol></ol><p>Which adaptation procedure should we go with?</p><ul><li><strong>Training can be challenging due to overfitting</strong> (just imagine fine-tuning a 175 billion parameter model based on 5 examples). How to do this effectively will be the topic of the adaptation lecture.<li>For now, we will be content with <strong>adaptation of GPT-3 using prompting</strong>. Note that the limitation of prompting is that we can only leverage a only small number of training instances (as many as can fit into a prompt). This is due to a limitation of Transformers, where the prompt and the completion must fit into 2048 tokens.</ul><p>The GPT-3 paper evaluated GPT-3 on a large set of tasks. We will consider a subset of these, and for each task, discuss the following:</p><ol><li><strong>Definition</strong>: What is the task and its motivation?<li><strong>Adaptation</strong>: How do we reduce the task to language modeling (via prompting)?<li><strong>Results</strong>: What are the quantitative numbers compared to task-specific state-of-the-art models?</ol><p><strong>Size and number of examples matters</strong>. By default, the results will based on</p><ul><li>the full GPT-3 model (davinci), which has 175 billion parameters<li>using in-context learning with as many training instances as you can stuff into the prompt.</ul><p>Along the way, we will do ablations to see if model size and number of in-context training instances matters. Spoiler: it does and more is better.</p><p>The tasks are grouped as follows:</p><ol><li><a href="#language-modeling">Language modeling</a><li><a href="#question-answering">Question answering</a><li><a href="#translation">Translation</a><li><a href="#arithmetic">Arithmetic</a><li><a href="#news-article-generation">News article generation</a><li><a href="#novel-tasks">Novel tasks</a></ol><p>The goals of this lecture is to provide:</p><ol><li>an overview of tasks in NLP (independent of large language models),<li>a sense of how well GPT-3 works, and<li>a taste for the art of prompt engineering.</ol><h2 id="language-modeling"> <a href="#language-modeling" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="language-modeling"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Language modeling</h2><p>The most natural starting point for thinking about what a language model can do is to ask if it can do the thing that language models are supposed to do: model language.</p><p>Recall that a language model \(p\) is a probability distribution over sequences of tokens. Suppose we take a corpus of text \(x_{1:L}\), for example:</p>\[\nl{the mouse ate the cheese}\]<p>We can ask: what is the probability the language model assigns to it?</p>\[p(\nl{the mouse ate the cheese})\]<p>Recall that we can break down the the joint probability into the product of the conditional probabilities for each token by the chain rule:</p>\[p(x_{1:L}) = \prod_{i=1}^L p(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1}).\]<p><strong>Perplexity</strong>. The joint probability of a sequence depends on its length and thus <strong>goes to zero</strong> as the length grows, which makes it hard to track. (Just think about trying to get a better estimate of perplexity on newswire by getting more newswire.)</p><p>Intuitively we want to average the per token probabilities \(p(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1})\). We don’t want to take the arithmetic average because assigning a token probability 0 is really bad (think about coding: your code length would be infinite), but the arithmetic average doesn’t penalize you for that. Instead, we want the <strong>geometric average</strong>, which is exactly what perplexity does:</p>\[\perplexity_p(x_{1:L}) = \exp\left(\frac{1}{L} \sum_{i=1}^L \log \frac{1}{p(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1})}\right).\]<p>Perplexity can be interpreted as the <strong>average “branching factor”</strong> per token. Recall that \(\log \frac{1}{p(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1})}\) is the code length. We are taking the average code length; exponentiating provides the number of possibilities. For intuition, take uniform distribution: a bitstring of length of 3 can encode \(2^3\) possible strings.</p><p><strong>Tale of two errors</strong>. There are two types of errors a language model can make, and perplexity treats them asymmetrically:</p><ul><li><strong>Recall error</strong>: The language model fails to place probability mass on some token. Perplexity has no mercy:</ul>\[p(\nl{ate} \mid \nl{the}, \nl{mouse}) \to 0 \quad\Rightarrow\quad \perplexity_p(\nl{the}, \nl{mouse}, \nl{ate}, \nl{the}, \nl{cheese}) \to \infty.\]<ul><li><strong>Precision error</strong>: The language model places extra probability mass on some bad sequences. Perplexity provides a slap on the wrist. Given a language model \(p\), suppose we mix in some garbage distribution \(r\) with probability \(\epsilon\):</ul>\[q(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1}) = (1-\epsilon) p(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1}) + \epsilon r(x_i \mid x_{1:i-1}).\]<p>Then we can compute the perplexity of \(x_{1:L}\) under \(q\):</p>\[\perplexity_q(x_{1:L}) \le \frac{1}{1 - \epsilon} \perplexity_p(x_{1:L}) \approxeq (1 + \epsilon) \perplexity_p(x_{1:L}),\]<p>where the last approximate equality holds for small values of \(\epsilon\). If we mix in 5% junk, then perplexity only by 5%. Note that the resulting language is horrible for generation, since every 20 tokens on average it’s just going to generate a gibberish token.</p><p>Now let’s get on with evaluating perplexity on an actual dataset.</p><h3 id="penn-tree-bank"> <a href="#penn-tree-bank" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="penn-tree-bank"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Penn Tree Bank</h3><p>The <a href="https://catalog.ldc.upenn.edu/LDC99T42">Penn Tree Bank</a> is a classic dataset in NLP, originally annotated for syntactic parsing.
