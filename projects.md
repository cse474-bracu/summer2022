# Final Projects

For this course, instead of final assessment, there will be a capstone project that you will be working on.

It is best to start looking for project ideas as soon as possible, but we initiate collecting your project ideas by the first week after midterm exam.

The ideal time to start working on your project is also as soon as possible, but as soon as we collect your project ideas and approve the final one, we ask you to start by then.

The tentative deadline to submit the final project, is in around the day after final week. Your submission includes:

- Your Final Project Code(s)
- Your Final Project Presentation Slides
- Your Final Project Report

And there will be a presentation as well. The tentative day of presentation is in around the day after the deadline to submit your final project.

Tentative Structure to Write The Report:

- Introduction
- Related Works/Literature Review
- Methodology
- Results
- Discussion
- Conclusion and Future Work

While there are many ways to write a good report, we provide some examples:

1. [https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2762076.pdf](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1174/reports/2762076.pdf)
2. [http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/default_116622008.pdf](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/reports/default_116622008.pdf)

Usual Guidelines:

1. As the internet can be a reason for disturbance in the lab, please download your code, presentation slides, and report in your pendrive/external hdd and keep that along with you.
2. Printout the final report along with you for your convenience.
3. Obviously, please be present 20-25 mins earlier than your slot.
4. Rest of you are suggested to be present to watch others' presentations besides your allotted timeslot in the lab since you may find some exciting ideas and/or possible collaborations to work on with someone of the same interest in the future.
5. Timeslot: 10-15 mins for presentation and rest for Q/A.
